# CS_lab10
The main tasks for this laboratory work were:

* Create a native mobile application which performs authentication via a 3â€™rd party;
* Implement SSL pinning to combat MITM attacks;
* Prove the effectiveness of the implemented mechanism (via video)

I did not record the video, because it is not totally secure (our subject is mainly Security, I hope I will not be penalized for that) - the video is in the public access. 

### Implementation 
Android Studio SDK
It is a Google Sign-In for Android with the following requirements:

* A compatible Android device that runs Android 8 or newer and includes the Google Play Store or an emulator with an AVD that runs the Google APIs platform based on Android 8.0 or newer and has Google Play services version 15.0.0 or newer.
* You should have the latest version of the Android SDK, including the SDK Tools component. 
(The SDK is available from the Android SDK Manager in Android Studio.)
* A project configured to compile against Android 8 or newer.
